# Read Me! #

This module is designed to contain commonly used utilities within this project.

It should only contain functions and classes that make sense to be included on
a library available via `pip install`, but not actually available, otherwise,
we'd prefer to use that version.

This module *should not* depend on any other module.


# Future #
Once the project gets off the ground, consider moving this app
to a proper module, versioned using Semantic Versioning, hosted on a private
PyPI server. See [here](https://gist.github.com/Jaza/fcea493dd0ba6ebf09d3) for
how to do this.
